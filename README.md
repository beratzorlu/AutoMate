## Technical Design

### Data Model - Entity Relationship Diagram

[Draw.io](https://www.drawio.com/) was a highly beneficial resource that provided significant help in building a ERP to illustrate the various table relationships of data models present in the project.

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around user interaction and content sharing. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the application without adding much real value to the user experience overall. There are [records available](#future-features) as a part of this documentation that demonstrate the change in scope that took place moving further into development.

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the application as a whole.

## Future Features

This section documents the features that were taken out of consideration for the benefit of the completion of the minimum viable project. The central observation in this area is that the level of ambition that the project initially set out with does not match with the intellectual labour required to complete a significant sum of the features first assigned. Below, are user stories that were deemed no longer necessary. You can view the full kanbar board used for project planning [here](https://github.com/users/beratzorlu/projects/4/views/1).

That being said, these features remain relevant to the overall scope of the project and it would see them expand its functional capacity in the future if the situation allowed it.

| Won't Have | Direct Messaging |
| Won't Have | Unfollow Users |
| Won't Have | Admin/Inappropriate Blog Posts#52 |

This application has been deployed by using the Heroku cloud platform. Please find below the neccessary procdures to replicate the deployment process.

You can find a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) prepared by Code Institute that is designed to display this backend application in a modern web browser. This allows the project to be accessible for users without the need of any third party software other than an Internet browser application.

### Heroku Deployment

This project utilizes the services available at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows users to build, deploy, and control applications in a cloud environment.

Disclaimer: To be able successfully replicate the Heroku deployment process, it is highly reccomended that users setup an account on the platform prior to following the steps provided below.

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard after log-in.
- Select navigate to the *Create new app* button from the dropdown menu and select it.
- Assign a unique name to your application.
- Navigate to the *region* dropdown menu and select the region closest to you from either EU or USA. 
- Select *Create App*.
- Navigate to your newly created application and select *Settings*. 
- Click *Reveal Config Vars*.
- Add first *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `CREDS`, copy and paste the data in your credentials file (ie. creds.json) into the value area.
- Add second *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- You need to add support to dependencies to be able to successfully deploy application, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order in which you list your dependencies is critical, select `Python` as the first dependency.
- From the same menu, select `Node.js` after you select `Python`. (You can drag the list items upwards and downwards to change their order if needed.)
- Scroll until you find your desired deployment method, select `Enable Automatic Deploy` to rebuild your project automatically every time you push a new commit. Select `Manual Deployment` to manually deploy from your desired branch on will.*

*If you have selected automatic deployment, your application will only deploy after your first push to the system.

After the completion of this process, Heroku needs two files further to deploy successfully. These are;
    - requirements.txt
    - Procfile

To install your project's requirements use: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 

If you have third party packages in your project the requirements file needs updated, use: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

To create your Procfile, use: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal (CLI), connect to Heroku using this: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace <app_name> with your chosen name for your application without the angle-brackets)
- Input commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to GitHub sequentially.
- Finally, type `git push heroku main` in the terminal to connect to Github.

Alternatively, you can connect to your Github account by following the below steps on Heroku's platform.

- Navigate to your Heroku account dashboard.
- Find the relevant project and click on its icon.
- On the next page, navigate to the `Deploy` subsection.
- Scroll down until you find `Deployment method` and find `Use Github`.
- Finally, input your Github account credentials to complete the process.

## Credits and References

### Repositories

- [Code Institute](#): CI's curriculum provided the main knowledge-base required to create and finalize this project. Various academic modules and the tasks available in them helped understand Django before the start of the development process.
    - [Hello Django](#): This walkthrough project provided significant practice for understanding how to implement CRUD functionality to a Django application.
    - [I Think Therefore I Blog](#): While more difficult to fully understand, the concepts demonstrated in this walkthrough project allowed for a deeper understanding of Django admin and site operations. More specifically, pagination was a difficult element to fully implement to this project. The code available here provided the help needed to integrate a pagination system to the project.
- [adamgilroy](https://github.com/adamgilroy22/tribe/): This was an inspirational project that offers an expansive set of features. Beacuse of this I would like to congratualte Adam Gilroy for his excellent work. Reading through his code helped me understand how to compartmentalize code, add security against unauthorized access to published user content, and how to work class based views.
- [CHCheshire](https://github.com/CHCheshire/Project-blog/tree/main): This project helped me understand managing comments from the frontend when building associated CRUD functionality.
- [stephaniecrocker91](https://github.com/stephaniecrocker91/for-the-love-of-food): This project provided a live perspective towards connecting models from different applications with each other.
