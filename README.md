### Colour Palette


[Coolors](https://coolors.co/) was a highly beneficial resource in this regard which provided significant help in identifying
matching colours that also have appropriate contrast.

## Website Features

The design considerations that impacted the envisioned features were mainly structured around CLI-based considerations. While there were more features planned in the initial stages of the project, some were not entertained to the benefit of serving the needs referenced in the [User Stories](#user-stories) section. Thus, it was important to focus on a minimum viable project rather than prioritizing the implementation of further features for the sake of it. This would only bloat the application without adding much real value to the user experience overall.

### Application Elements

The below elements are available to be experienced by the user across the quiz game application as a whole.

## Bug Fixes

In this section, all bugs that cased fatal errors that prevented the successful execution of the application and their relevant fixes are provided.

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| get_username() 'None' Text Display: A bug where a 'None' text appeared during when the system was expecting input from the user for their username. | Fixed by removing the print element nested inside an outer input element. Click [here](https://github.com/beratzorlu/python-quiz/commit/d3fc300dc47d88aecd65f99b7ab7cbb6ca6f13b7) to review the relevant commit. |

## Deployment

This application has been deployed by using the Heroku cloud platform. Please find below the neccessary procdures to replicate the deployment process.

You can find a [template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) prepared by Code Institute that is designed to display this backend application in a modern web browser. This allows the project to be accessible for users without the need of any third party software other than an Internet browser application.

### Local Deployment 

Gitpod IDE is the development environment for this project.

If you wish to make copy of this repository locally, you can clone it by inputting the following code into your preferred integrated development environment (IDE):
- `git clone https://github.com/beratzorlu/python-quiz.git`

As anoher method, you can click below button to create your own workspace using this repository if you are using Gitpod.e

### Heroku Deployment

This project utilizes the services available at [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com). Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows users to build, deploy, and control applications in a cloud environment.

Disclaimer: To be able successfully replicate the Heroku deployment process, it is highly reccomended that users setup an account on the platform prior to following the steps provided below.

- Select *New* in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard after log-in.
- Select navigate to the *Create new app* button from the dropdown menu and select it.
- Assign a unique name to your application.
- Navigate to the *region* dropdown menu and select the region closest to you from either EU or USA. 
- Select *Create App*.
- Navigate to your newly created application and select *Settings*. 
- Click *Reveal Config Vars*.
- Add first *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `CREDS`, copy and paste the data in your credentials file (ie. creds.json) into the value area.
- Add second *Config Var*.
- Set the value of KEY to `PORT`, and the value to `8000` then select *add*.
- You need to add support to dependencies to be able to successfully deploy application, select *Add Buildpack*.
- The order in which you list your dependencies is critical, select `Python` as the first dependency.
- From the same menu, select `Node.js` after you select `Python`. (You can drag the list items upwards and downwards to change their order if needed.)
- Scroll until you find your desired deployment method, select `Enable Automatic Deploy` to rebuild your project automatically every time you push a new commit. Select `Manual Deployment` to manually deploy from your desired branch on will.*

*If you have selected automatic deployment, your application will only deploy after your first push to the system.

After the completion of this process, Heroku needs two files further to deploy successfully. These are;
    - requirements.txt
    - Procfile

To install your project's requirements use: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. 

If you have third party packages in your project the requirements file needs updated, use: `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

To create your Procfile, use: `echo web: node index.js > Procfile`

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your GitHub repository to the newly created app:

- In the Terminal (CLI), connect to Heroku using this: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a <app_name>` (replace <app_name> with your chosen name for your application without the angle-brackets)
- Input commands `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` to GitHub sequentially.
- Finally, type `git push heroku main` in the terminal to connect to Github.

Alternatively, you can connect to your Github account by following the below steps on Heroku's platform.

- Navigate to your Heroku account dashboard.
- Find the relevant project and click on its icon.
- On the next page, navigate to the `Deploy` subsection.
- Scroll down until you find `Deployment method` and find `Use Github`.
- Finally, input your Github account credentials to complete the process.
